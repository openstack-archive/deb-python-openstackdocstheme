    The automatic table of contents that appears in the body of the
    documentation can be disabled by setting ``display_toc`` to ``False`` in
    the ``html_theme_options`` option in ``conf.py``.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

      html_theme_options = {
           "display_toc": False,
      }
