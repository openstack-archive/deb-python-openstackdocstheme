    The ability to customise the bug title for the 'Report a Bug'
    link is now available. To customise the bug title used add
    the ``bug_title`` key with a value to ``html_context`` in the
    Sphinx configuration.

    For example:

    ::

      html_context = {"bug_title": 'Documentation bug', ...}
